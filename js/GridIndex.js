	// Terrarium needs to use a movement algorithm that moves a large number of elements down independent paths and has them
	// stop if they bump into each other during this movement (we make this problem more tractable by dividing the screen up
	// into cells so there aren't as many positions to calculate).  This is further complicated by the fact that creatures occupy
	// more than one cell in the game grid, and that, if they get blocked in movement, we need to know what they bumped into so 
	// we can notify the creature.
	// 
	// The basic approach Terrarium takes to moving is this: Imagine if you walked a loop that touched each creature
	// in turn and moved them just a little bit at a time (called a "MovementSegment").  You stop moving a creature when it 
	// can't occupy the entire set of cells it requires to move to the next MovementSegment in it's path or when it is simply
	// done moving. 
	//
	// Since a creature's size is bigger than one cell, it actually occupies multiple cells in the game space. To move it,
	// we need to ensure that it can occupy all of the cells in it's new location.  Thus, a key idea in the algorithm is that each
	// "MovementSegment" of its journey is pointed to by the set of cells it occupies at that point in time (SegmentWrappers do the 
	// pointing) and that the MovementSegment gets "resolved" when we know if the set of SegmentWrappers that point to it can move
	// where they need to move to represent the entire space the creature needs.  "Resolved" means we are guaranteed it either:
	// - successfully passes through the cells without stopping OR 
	// - will stop in the cells OR 
	// - got clipped and won't occupy these cells
	// Until we resolve a MovementSegment, we can't resolve its previous MovementSegment in the path (except the starting MovementSegment
	// which is always guaranteed to validly occupy a cell since it started there) because its state in one set of cells depends on 
	// what it does next.  For example, if it can't occupy all of the cells in the next MovementSegment, it must stop in
	// previous set of cells.
	//
	// Here's the algorithm:
	// 1. Break up the path a creature wants to follow on a given turn into a number of "MovementSegments" by laying the path out
	//      on the grid we use in the game and chopping it up whenever the path enters or leaves a cell.  Mark the time it entered
	//      and leaves the cell (this is done by the AddPath() function).
	// 2. Put pointers to this single MovementSegment in every cell that the creature occupies at that point in time.  These pointers
	//      are called "SegmentWrappers" (this is done by the AddSegment() function).
	// 3. Sort all SegmentWrappers by EntryTime (the time they entered a cell), and then by State.ID for those where the EntryTime 
	//      is the same.  This guarantees that we walk through all SegmentWrappers that should be moved together right after each
	//      other so we can resolve whether the move can occur.  We need to incrementally move all creatures at once because we want
	//      them to bump into each other if they cross paths at the right time instead of jumping over each other.
	// 4. Walk through each SegmentWrapper in sorted order and try to "resolve" them:
	//      If the SegmentWrapper is blocked from being in its cell by an active segment that is already in that cell it is "clipped".
	//          Clip all subsequent segments and leave the previous segment as active.
	//      If a segment is not clipped, reduce CellsLeftToResolve by one since this SegmentWrapper can validly occupy this cell.
	//          once CellsLeftToResolve hits zero, this means that the state of all SegmentWrappers that use this segment have
	//          been resolved and the segment will get marked as "active" meaning that we know all of the cells the organism wants to 
	//          occupy can be used at this point in time.  We also unset the active bit on the previous segment in the chain.
